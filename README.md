## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/). This module currently tested on `0.11.14`

## Quick Start
Terraform module to create all mandatory VPC components.

This module supports either single-tier (only public subnet) or multi-tier (public-app-data subnets) VPC creation.
This module supports only up to 4 AZs.

### Multi-Tier VPC

```hcl
module "abc_dev" {
  source  = "traveloka/vpc/aws"
  version = "v0.2.3"
  
  product_domain = "abc"
  environment    = "dev"

  vpc_name       = "abc-dev"
  vpc_cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"
}
```

We use multi-tier architecture for our VPC design. This design divides the infrastructure into three layers: 
- Public tier: entrypoint for public-facing client. Using public subnet since resources in this tier will be discoverable through Internet. Examples: external load balancer, bastion, etc.
- Application Tier: this is where the business logic services life and communicate each others. This tier using private subnet, hence it's only accessible through private network.
- Database Tier: this is where databases life. Application and databases are seperated to have clear boundaries and secure access through application tier.

Benefits or having multi-tier architecture are:
- Scalable
- Gives us high availability and redundancy
- Fit with microservices architecture
- Clear boundaries between public-facing, business logic, and data storage
- Secure and reduce risk, because by default any services life at private subnet, and database only accessible through the application tier.

### Single-Tier VPC

In some cases, you will need a VPC which has only public subnets.

```hcl
module "abc_dev" {
  source  = "traveloka/vpc/aws"
  version = "v0.2.3"

  # you only need to add this line
  vpc_multi_tier = false 

  # ... omitted
}
```

In some situations (it is not always happening), you will get some errors from Terraform when you set `vpc_multi_tier = false`.
It happens because several resources were not created but stated as the outputs.
Currrently Terraform does not allow `count` inside `output` block, so now it is inevitable.
But don't worry, the errors have nothing to do with the stacks/resources/infrastructures that you created.
Just re-execute `terraform apply` and you will be fine.
